# SuperOsma Arrow - Trading Robot

This code is a trading robot that uses the SuperOsma indicator to generate trading signals. The SuperOsma indicator calculates the OsMA (Moving Average of Oscillator) and identifies overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

## Indicator Constants

The code includes the following indicator constants:
- `indicator_chart_window`: Specifies that the indicator should be displayed in a separate chart window.
- `indicator_buffers 2`: Sets the number of indicator buffers to 2.
- `indicator_color1 Aqua`: Sets the color of the first indicator buffer to Aqua.
- `indicator_color2 Red`: Sets the color of the second indicator buffer to Red.

## Global Variables

The code defines two global variables `BuyBuffer[]` and `SellBuffer[]` to store the buy and sell signals generated by the indicator.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers and labels.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It cleans up the indicator buffers.

## Calculation Function

The `OnCalculate()` function is called whenever new price data is available. It calculates the SuperOsma indicator values for each bar and generates buy and sell signals based on the values.

## Custom Functions

The `DisplayDashboard()` function analyzes the generated signals and displays dashboard information such as the win-rate percentage, number of winners, and number of losers.

## Execution Entry Point

The `OnTick()` function is the execution entry point of the code. It is called on each tick and performs the necessary actions, such as displaying the dashboard information.
